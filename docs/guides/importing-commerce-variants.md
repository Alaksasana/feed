# Importing Commerce Variants

This guide will serve as a real-world example of importing Commerce Products into [Craft Commerce](http://craftcommerce.com). We'll be importing two T-Shirt products into Commerce, each with their own set of variants. This guide specifically deals with **multiple-variant** products.

#### Things to note

- We've got multiple products, and multiple variants. Product information should be stored under each variant.
- `sku` is compulsory for each variant
- `length`, `width`, `height` and `weight` should all be units according to your Commerce settings
- We have a `title` for the product, and `title`'s for each variant

Choose either the XML or JSON (depending on your preference), and save as a file in the root of your public directory. We'll assume its `http://craft.local/variants-feed.xml`.
